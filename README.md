# Minimum Cost Flow Optimization

This repo contains code to run minimum cost optimization using Python's networkX, pulp and pydantic.

All required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. 

The `src` directory contains all code files. The file `flowGraph.py` defines and optimize a flow network, `flowViz.py` is used to visulize the optmized solution.

The `notebook` directory contains the notebook `milp_flow.ipynb` that demonstrates how to use code of this repo.
